# Problem statement from Kattis:
# 
# "An eccentric coach asks players on the team to line up alphabetically 
# at the start of practice. The coach does not tell the players whether 
# they need to line up in increasing or decreasing order, so they guess. 
# If they guess wrong, the coach makes them run laps before practice. Given 
# a list of names, you are to determine if the list is in increasing alphabetical 
# order, decreasing alphabetical order or neither."
