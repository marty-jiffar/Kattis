# Problem description from Kattis:
#
# "In the popular show 'Dinner for Five', five contestants compete in preparing 
# culinary delights. Every evening one of them makes dinner and each of other 
# four then grades it on a scale from 1 to 5. The number of points a contestant 
# gets is equal to the sum of grades they got. The winner of the show is of course
# the contestant that gets the most points.
# Write a program that determines the winner and how many points they got."

def solve(contestant_scores):

    d = {}
    winner = 0
    points = 0
    i = 1

    for i, contestant in enumerate(contestant_scores):
        current_points = (contestant_scores[i][0] + contestant_scores[i][1] + 
            contestant_scores[i][2] + contestant_scores[i][3])
        if current_points > points:
            winner = i + 1
            points = current_points

    return winner, points
